Welcome to Pauli-θ's documentation page!


Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation page for Pauli-θ, the world's first open hardware photonic quantum computer! If you are new to this documentation, we recommend that you read the introduction page to get an overview of what this documentation has to offer.

Quick-overview
--------------
The biggest problem with quantum computers is accessibility. Quantum hardware is by nature expensive and many research papers on such are locked behind pay walls. Our goal is to make quantum computing hardware more accessible by making it open and available publicly for free.
This project is meant to make bare-bones quantum hardware more accessible. To accomplish that we decided to make our findings available for free under the GNU license.
This page  is meant to be more digestible than researching individually difficult to read papers.
Make no mistake, this doesn't mean that this is your average article speaking about the quantum world.
We provide simple to understand animated (Coming Soon) examples for newcomers, some math for enthusiasts, and researching papers along with gate designs for people with experience.

About Pauli-θ
-------------

A quantum computer is without a doubt a very complex piece of technology and it is therefore difficult to present Pauli-θ in just a few words. So we will take our time to analyze such complex topics in an easy to understand manner. But before we jump deep into the topic, let's go over a quick synopsis about Pauli-θ.

Synopsis
--------

Pauli-θ is a model of a photonic quantum computer. In other words, it is a quantum computer that uses photons and their polarization as qubits to perform calculations. It provides a comprehensive set of gates, so users can focus on designing their own quantum circuits without having to reinvent the wheel. We want to make this project a template for everyone to base their designs upon. In addition to that Pauli-θ is completely free and open source. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing.

Organization of the documentation
---------------------------------

This documentation is organized in five sections with an relatively balanced distribution of contents – but the way it is split up should be relatively intuitive:

+ The *Introduction* contains this introduction as well as this project's goals which were mentioned above. 

+ The *Maths section* is here to provide a refresh on linear algebra. It is not required to preview this documentation but for anyone who wants to take a closer look, they should familiarize themselves with those concepts.

+ The *Component explanation section* can be read as needed, in any order. It contains simple information about photonic hardware components used in the design.

+ The *Computer design section* is the main attraction of this documentation, as it contains all the necessary information on how the computer works in an simplistic manner.

+ The *Closing arguments section* has some resources for those who want to advance their knowledge and special thanks to some people who helped and supported this project.

Have fun reading this documentation and feel free to help us improve as this documentation is only in it's beta stage


Maths
=====================

This section is designed to teach you a little bit of linear algebra because it will be used in our computer a lot.
Linear algebra is crucial to both polarization and quantum physics so we will focus on that mainly.
NOTE: If you taken any linear algebra class this should be completely unnecessary so feel free to skip it

This section will include: 

+ Vectors 
+ Vector operations
+ Matrices
+ Tensor product
+ Bloch sphere

Vectors
-------

To explain everything behind quantum computing and generally anything quantum related, basic knowledge of linear algebra is absolutely req. 
That is why in this section we’ll be briefly explaining most of the basic principles of linear algebra as a refresh.
We suggest you learn proper linear algebra in order to continue (`here <https://codebook.xanadu.ai/>`__ and `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PL0-GT3co4r2y2YErbmuJw2L5tW4Ew2O5B>`__) 

Vectors are the heart and soul of linear algebra and the most important geometric object when trying to describe qubits. 
To first understand vectors, we need to define and separate scalars from vectors.


Scalar is a quantity having only magnitude and no direction. If only 
α is a Real number

Vector is a quantity with both magnitude and direction. They are symbolized with an arrow across the top

   .. math::
      \vec{u}

Where n the number of dimensions in a mathematical space. Examples: 
   
   .. math::

      \alpha \in \mathbb{R}^n
   
   .. math::
      u \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \vec{u} = 
       \begin{pmatrix} 
    x \\ y
    \end{pmatrix}

   .. math::
      U \in \mathbb{R}^3 : \vec{U} = 
      \begin{pmatrix} 
    x \\ y \\ z
    \end{pmatrix}

Vector magnitude describes the length of the vector:

   .. math::

      \| \vec{u} \| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}

Vector direction shows the direction the vector is pointing:

.. math::

   \tan \theta = \frac{ y }{ x }, x \ne 0

Vector operations
-----------------

Now we will very briefly go over a few of the vector operations which will be very useful in our computations later. If you don't feel very comfortable with these concepts
we suggest that you practice before continuing this is meant more as a refresh. 

- Vector addition

    x_{\alpha} + x_{\beta} \\
    y_{\beta} + y_{\beta} \\
  \end{array} } \right]

  \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
    x_{\alpha} - x_{-\beta} \\
    y_{\beta} - y_{-\beta} \\
  \end{array} } \right]
\

.. math::
   \phi * \vec{\alpha} =
     \left[ {\begin{array}{cc}
    \phi * x \\
    \phi * y \\
  \end{array} } \right]

- Inner product 
We define inner product is the operation between 2 non-zero vectors  and that always gives a scalar result. It can be symbolized as:

.. math::
   \vec{\alpha} \cdot \vec{\beta} = x_{\vec{\alpha}} \cdot x_{\vec{\beta}} + y_{\vec{\alpha}} \cdot y_{\vec{\beta}}

Inner product can be used as a tool for calculating the magnitude:

.. math::
   \langle\vec{u},\vec{u}\rangle = \vec{u} \cdot \vec{u}\dagger = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {u_1 \cdot u_1} = \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n =  {\| \vec{u} \|}^2

Or for vector normalization:

.. math::
   \frac{\vec{u}}{\sqrt{\langle\vec{u} , \vec{u}\rangle}} = \frac{\vec{u}}{\|\vec{u}\|}

Matrices
--------

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, symbols and expressions arranged in columns and rows, used to to mathematically describe objects such as quantum gates. 
For example:

.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix} 
   1 & 2 & 3 \\
   4 & 5 & 6
   \end{pmatrix}

That is a matrix called “2x3 matrix” because it consists of 2 rows and 3 columns.  
A matrix is called unitary when its conjugate transpose is also its inverse.  

Tensor product
--------------
Tensor product the only matrix operation we really recommend that you get very familiar with it since it's used a lot in quantum computing. We will simply offer a refresh here but you can read more `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product>`__

.. math::
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \alpha \\
   \beta
   \end{pmatrix} 
   \otimes 
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \gamma \\
   \delta
   \end{pmatrix}
   =
   \begin{pmatrix}
   \alpha * \begin{pmatrix} \gamma \\ \delta \end{pmatrix}
   \beta * \begin{pmatrix} \gamma \\ \delta \end{pmatrix}
   \end{pmatrix}



Bloch sphere
------------

The Bloch sphere (named after Felix Bloch) is one of the most fundamental concepts of quantum computing.
In essence, the Bloch sphere is a geometrical representation of the pure state space of a qubit. In the poles of the sphere we have the 2 states of our qubit and a 
vector representing the state of the system. Basically, it is a unit sphere used to visualize the probability data we get from measuring our computer. **IMPORTANT**: 
The bloch sphere is a 2D space and not a 3D space as the name sphere may suggest.

Fundamental concepts
====================

One of the most important things to understand while creating a photonic quantum computer is of course light, and more importantly photons. This section is designed to help you understand some basic characteristics of photons that are needed for our computer to work. Feel free to revisit this section at any time!

Polarization
------------
In the beginning we mentioned polarization as the main physical phenomenon behind our computer but what exactly is polarization? Well in wikipedia’s words “Polarization is a property applying to transverse waves that specifies the geometrical orientation of the oscillations. In a transverse wave, the direction of the oscillation is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the wave”. But what does this mean exactly? To put it in simpler words, polarization is the θ° angle of the light’s waveform on a x’x axis.

.. figure:: /images/image1.png
   :align: center

   :alt:

   `48-2 Resnick, Halliday, Krane Physics, volume 2 <https://www.amazon.com/Physics-2-David-Halliday/dp/0471401943>`__



For example, as you can see in the picture below, the blue waveform has a 0° angle while the red waveform has a 90° angle.
So we can confidently say that one is perpendicular to the other. So that why we can say that the red waveform has vertical polarization *in relation* to the blue on.
Please take into account that light polarization is measure in relation to something else. Another important characteristic is the wavelength of the wave. We define wavelength as the distance between two peaks in the graph.

Reflection
----------
Reflection is a pretty well-known concept with no need for an introduction, but for the sake of completeness we will briefly explain what it is and what it does. Reflection is the change in the direction of a waveform. Reflection can be seen in light, sound and even water waves. Now, the reflection of light can be categorized as specular reflection or diffuse reflection, depending on the surface on which it is reflected from. Specular reflection is a regular reflection of a light beam from a mirror-like surface.

   :align: center
   :scale: 30%
   :alt:

   `Specular reflection by wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_Reflection>`__

We will mainly focus on specular reflections since we will be using mirrors to redirect the photons.
There are 3 types of rays in specular reflection you must understand:


+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|Incident ray   |   The ray coming out of the surface                                  |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Normal        |   The normal vector of the Incident ray                              |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Reflected ray |   The ray going out of the surface after it has been reflected       |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+



Single photon generation
------------------------

Understanding single photon generation is fundamental when working with photons. Most traditional light sources such as the light bulb are coherent light sources, meaning that they produce a stream of photons whereas SPE produce only 1 photon.
However, our computer uses only a single photon as qubit (xanadu's and other programable quantum computers use something known as a squeezed state of light which works fundamentally different from our design but you check more if you are interested here:    `Squeezed states by wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezed_states_of_light>`__)
So we need to find a reliable source to generate our qubit. As of right now there is no known way to consistently produce a single photon but rather we rely on 
probabilistic sources to work. 

Component explanations
======================

Polarized Beam Splitter (PBS)
--------------------------
Let’s start with our first and most used component, the polarized beam splitter. A PBS is an optical component meant to differentiate between the horizontal and vertical
polarization. This simply means that if a photon is vertically polarized (in relation to the component's orientation) it will pass through it normally but,
if it's horizontally polarized, it will get reflected 90° as shown by the graphic below.

.. figure:: /images/PBS.png

   `PBS <https://homepages.wmich.edu/~rosentha/pdf%20files/13_Beamsplitters.PDF>`__


Polarization Rotator/Pauli-X
----------------------------
A polarization rotator is a pretty simple optical component. All it does, is rotate the polarization axis by an angle θ.
So if θ = 90° a vertically polarized photon becomes horizontally. This means that
if the angle θ = 90° the rotator works exactly like a Pauli-X also known as a bit flip!

   `Polarization rotator by wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_rotator>`__


Photomultiplier Tube
--------------------
Photomultiplier tubes work as very sensitive light detectors, that are able to detect individual photons. To do this they
use a phenomenon known as `photoelectric effect <https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/quantum-physics/photons/a/photoelectric-effect>`__
some electrons get ejected.

Computer design
===============

Single photon emitter (SPE)
---------------------------

The purpose of the single photon emitter (SPE) is to generate a single photon. 
While at first constructing such a device from inexpensive components might seem hard the truth is far from that thanks to a phenomenon called Spontaneous Parametric
Down Conversion (SPDC). In essence, by using a special nonlinear crystal called KDP (which is relatively inexpensive) 
SPDC allows us to break a higher energy photon into two lower
energy, entangled photons. 


.. figure:: /images/SPDC.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 30%
   :alt:

   `Spontaneous parametric down-conversion by wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion>`__




While at glance one might think that we are done with our photon generation there is actually one more step to this process, breaking the entanglement. To do this we have designed a module we call the Disentangling Device.
As we briefly said above SPDC creates 2 entangled photons but in order to use those photons in any circuit we need to break their entanglement and set them in the |0⟩ state, that’s where
Disentangling Device comes into play. Disentangling Device. is nothing more than two polarized beam splitters with some mirrors in order to nondestructively collapse the 
entanglement between the 2 photons.

.. figure:: /images/DisentanglingDevice.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 200%
   :alt:

Then with some cleverly placed mirrors we can direct the photons into any circuit.

Hadamard Gate/Rx(θ)
-------------------
One of the most fundamental characteristics of any quantum system is its ability to be set into superposition. Superposition is a state in-between the states \|0⟩ and \|1⟩. 
Pauli-Θ uses the vertical and horizontal polarization states as \|0⟩ and \|1⟩ respectively. So in order to make it easier to understand, we define horizontal polarization (θ=0°) as \|0⟩ 
and vertical (θ=90°) as \|1⟩. Now, all the gate has to do to achieve superposition is to rotate the vector representing the state as shown below.

In order to do that, we use a polarization rotator to turn the photon from 0° to 45°. In this way, photons get transformed 
into the equal superposition state which when measured in the base of \|0⟩ or \|1⟩ have a 50% probability to be in either state. (But, if we measured in the 45° base we would have a 100% probability to be in that state.) 
Note: The polarization rotator can be turned into any degree imaginable (from 1-89) to alter the probability of each state in the superposition making it also an Rx gate. 

.. figure:: /images/Hadamard.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 30%
   :alt:

Another alternative of using a polarization rotator is the much cheaper polarizer which is commonly found in 3d cinema glasses. A polarizer blocks or allows a photon to pass depending on its polarization angle
For example, if a vertical polarizer will block a horizontal photon and vice versa. So in order to implement a Hadamard gate, one would have to use a polarizer rotated by 45°. This however means
that only 50% of \|0⟩ photons will pass.
For this reason, we using this approach only as way to play around with polarization because even though it is extremely cheap,  
it lowers the computer's accuracy by a substantial amount.


Controlled NOT Gate (CNOT)
--------------------------
The CNOT is a two qubit gate and it allows qubits to interact with each other.
This gate involves 2 qubits, a control qubit and a target one. If the control is in \|1⟩ state
Then the target qubit gets flipped, but if the control is in \|0⟩ then nothing happens and both qubits continue.
To implement such a gate in our system we use 2 PBS one op and one Controlled wave plate. All you need to know about the controlled wave plate is that it works exactly as an X gate (bit flip) but only when current is passing though it.
The control qubit goes through a PBS where it splits down 2 different paths, if its in \|0⟩ state, then it just continues to be measured. However if it's in the \|1⟩ state then it gets reflected by the first PBS gets nondestructively measured
and goes back in its original path. When it is measured current is passes through the controlled wave plate activating it.
