Welcome to Pauli-θ's documentation page!


Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation page for Pauli-θ, the world's first open hardware photonic quantum computer! If you are new to this documentation, we recommend that you read the introduction page to get an overview of what this documentation has to offer.

Quick-overview
--------------
The biggest problem with quantum computers is accessibility. Quantum hardware is by nature expensive and many research papers on such are locked behind pay walls. Our goal is to make quantum computing hardware more accessible by making it open and available publicly for free.
This project is meant to make bare-bones quantum hardware more accessible. To accomplish that we decided to make our findings available for free under the GNU license.
This page  is meant to be more digestible than researching individually difficult to read papers.
Make no mistake, this doesn't mean that this is your average article speaking about the quantum world.
We provide some custom, simple to understand animated examples for newcomers, some math for enthusiasts, and researching papers along with gate designs for people with experience.

About Pauli-θ
-------------

A quantum computer is without a doubt a very complex piece of technology and it is therefore difficult to present Pauli-θ in just a few words. So we will take our time to analyze such complex topics in an easy to understand manner. But before we jump deep into the topic, let's go over a quick synopsis about Pauli-θ.

Synopsis
--------

Pauli-θ is a model of a photonic quantum computer. In other words, it is a quantum computer that uses photons and their polarization as qubits to perform calculations. It provides a comprehensive set of gates, so users can focus on designing their own quantum circuits without having to reinvent the wheel. We want to make this project a template for everyone to base their designs upon. In addition to that Pauli-θ is completely free and open source. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing.

Organization of the documentation
---------------------------------

This documentation is organized in five sections with an relatively balanced distribution of contents – but the way it is split up should be relatively intuitive:

+ The *Introduction* contains this introduction as well as this project's goals which were mentioned above. 

+ The *Mathematics section* is here to provide a refresh on linear algebra. It is not required to preview this documentation but for anyone who wants to take a closer look, they should familiarize themselves with those concepts.

+ The *Component explanation section* can be read as needed, in any order. It contains simple information about photonic hardware components used in the design.

+ The *Computer design section* is the main attraction of this documentation, as it contains all the necessary information on how the computer works in an simplistic manner.

+ The *Closing arguments section* has some resources for those who want to advance their knowledge.
