Component explanations
======================

Polarized Beam Splitter (PBS)
--------------------------
Let’s start with our first and most used component, the polarized beam splitter. A PBS is an optical component meant to differentiate between the horizontal and vertical
polarization. This simply means that if a photon is vertically polarized (in relation to the component's orientation) it will pass through it normally but,
if it's horizontally polarized, it will get reflected 90° as shown by the graphic below.

Polarization Rotator/Pauli-X
----------------------------
A polarization rotator is a pretty simple optical component. All it does, is rotate the polarization axis by an angle θ.
So if θ = 90° a vertically polarized photon becomes horizontally. This means that
if the angle θ = 90° the rotator works exactly like a Pauli-X also known as a bit flip!

Photomultiplier Tube
--------------------
Photomultiplier tubes work as very sensitive light detectors, that are able to detect individual photons. To do this they
use a phenomenon known as `photoelectric effect <https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/quantum-physics/photons/a/photoelectric-effect>`__
some electrons get ejected.
