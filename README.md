# Introduction


Welcome to the documentation page for Pauli-θ, the world's first open hardware photonic quantum computer! If you are new to this documentation, we recommend that you read the introduction page to get an overview of what this documentation has to offer.

## Quick-overview

The biggest problem with quantum computers is accessibility. Quantum hardware is by nature expensive and many research papers on such are locked behind pay walls. Our goal is to make quantum computing hardware more accessible by making it open and available publicly for free.
This project is meant to make bare-bones quantum hardware more accessible. To accomplish that we decided to make our findings available for free under the GNU license.
This page  is meant to be more digestible than researching individually difficult to read papers.
Make no mistake, this doesn't mean that this is your average article speaking about the quantum world.
We provide some custom, simple to understand animated examples for newcomers, some math for enthusiasts, and researching papers along with gate designs for people with experience.

## About Pauli-θ


A quantum computer is without a doubt a very complex piece of technology and it is therefore difficult to present Pauli-θ in just a few words. So we will take our time to analyze such complex topics in an easy to understand manner. But before we jump deep into the topic, let's go over a quick synopsis about Pauli-θ.

## Synopsis


Pauli-θ is a model of a photonic quantum computer. In other words, it is a quantum computer that uses photons and their polarization as qubits to perform calculations. It provides a comprehensive set of gates, so users can focus on designing their own quantum circuits without having to reinvent the wheel. We want to make this project a template for everyone to base their designs upon. In addition to that Pauli-θ is completely free and open source. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing.
